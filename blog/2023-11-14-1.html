            I started a playthrough of
            <a
              href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/statech-industry"
              >StaTech Industry</a
            >. It's a GregTech-inspired modpack for Minecraft, using
            <a
              href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-industrialization"
              >Modern Industrialization</a
            >
            as the core tech mod. The first thing I did was create a testing
            world in creative mode and take a gander through the questbook.
            Here's a few observations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It's really nice that the pack's questbook introduces the major
              mods and mechanics
            </li>
            <li>
              I immediately ignored the main questline to take a look at the
              side chapters - there's a few "collect 'em all" quests, although
              why the "World of Food" chapter categorizes regular pizza as a
              cursed food, I've not the faintest. And I heavily object to
              pineapple pizza being classed the same as uranium cereal!
            </li>
            <li>
              Create and the "World of Magic" chapters look like interesting
              diversions - I'm interested to see if there's a good balance
              between main quest progression and sidequest progression.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's interesting to note how the quests really shape progression.
              I'd disagree with punching trees being the start of a modern
              Minecraft playthrough - perhaps getting three logs for a boat is,
              but I usually ignore stone tools in favour of iron tools and an
              iron farm.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, fancy storage systems (a la iron chests and AE2) seem to be
              more heavily featured than I think is necessary for a good pack -
              MI's barrels and pipes should be good enough, no?
            </li>
            <li>
              I also take exception to the statement that paper production has
              been "Statified"! That's a vanilla MI recipe you're claiming
              there!
            </li>
            <li>
              I think there's going to be some very interesting cross-mod
              interactions - Create, for example, will probably trivialize early
              game smelting and plate production with its press and fan.
            </li>
            <li>
              On the subject of Create, I remember Static, the pack author,
              musing a year or so ago about wanting to make MI depend on Create
              (which was achieved), but also make andesite alloy depend on MI's
              mixer (which is a circular dependency). It seems this was broken
              by dropping andesite alloy's dependency on MI.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's interesting how the quarry isn't a strictly required quest -
              I suppose it is, in principle, possible to just mine for
              everything, but that's got to be annoying.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most MI recipes seem to have been kept intact - or at least the
              early-game ones. This is good; my knowledge from having played
              vanilla MI is still valid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Huh. They're letting us have infinite and simply renewable EU
              using the Create alternator. I'm sure this doesn't scale nicely to
              higher power requirements, but it's nice to have a backup power
              source.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oh, cool! They've got MI stuff added to Create's ponder system. I
              think there's an open request for Create to split the ponder
              system off into its own library so non-Create mods can also use
              it.
            </li>
            <li>Also, I guess a tree farm is useful sometimes?</li>
            <li>
              There seem to be a lot of alternative paths (alternative from the
              perspective of base MI) to resource production here - for example,
              plant oil seems like it's going to have greater significance since
              it's more easily produced now.
            </li>
            <li>
              Seems like TR is being used to "fill the gaps" in base MI - the
              autocrafting table from TR, for example, automates recipes that
              base MI doesn't, although passive energy production does generally
              seem to be pretty heavily limited - thankfully.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oh, interesting - there's a branching questline at the start of
              HV.
            </li>
            <li>
              This really feels like base MI with a few diversions - I suppose
              that's okay.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ah, but the endgame gets a lot more interesting. This might be a
              bit of a challenge. I remember only barely scraping across the
              finish line in my previous MI playthroughs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And in the next installment, I'm going to be actually playing the
            pack.
