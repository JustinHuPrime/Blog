          <p>
            As usual, I started doing some exploring first, and eventually found
            a village with not one but two meteors near it.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-2.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            After a day of looting the village and wandering around some more, I
            found a shipwreck and got a few diamonds from that, among other
            things. Wandering around a bit more, I found a ravine with an
            explorer's camp at the bottom, and decided to go have a look. Not
            much of interest down in the camp, actually. Upon returning to the
            surface, I had too many items and had to leave some behind in a
            cache.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, on to the quests. I clicked through the "welcome" chapter,
            getting myself a plain old iron sword. Having gotten a golden axe
            previously (from the shipwreck, I think), I set about not punching
            trees, but chopping down the trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm going to be pointedly ignoring the various storage mods, I think
            - MI provides a good enough storage system with its pipes and its
            barrels, and a few chests early game would be sufficient. Everything
            else seems like more effort than it's worth, especially AE2.
          </p>
          <p>
            A consideration I hadn't yet thought of was what my base was going
            to look like - I was probably going to do another underground base
            like I built in my vanilla MI playthroughs, so I'd better find a
            spot to build a staging camp of sorts. A shore near a ravine and a
            meteor would do. I cleared some space from the annoyingly tall
            prairie grass, and set down my chests (and I also fetched the nearby
            supply cache). Along the way, I mined some cobblestone, and equipped
            myself with stone tools. A bit of building later, and I had my
            staging camp.
          </p>

          <p>
            I then went down into the nearby ravine to go mining. Luckily, there
            was an iron and nickel ore deposit at the bottom of the ravine.
            Unluckily, there wasn't a source of coal I could find. I did chance
            upon a goblin trader who offered a most wonderful trade of two iron
            ingots for one raw iron. I then upgraded to iron tools and armour
            and a shield.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-4.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Despite the lack of a coal source so far, I decided to continue on
            with the main quest and get some andesite alloy.
          </p>
          <p>
            And taking a brief break from crafting, I went out and found a coal
            deposit, then returned and finished building my Create
            infrastructure - a double large waterwheel with a gearbox linking
            the two Create crafting machines I'll need to use.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-5.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Afterwards, I took a short jaunt and found a copper deposit. I've
            now got access to enough resources that I think I should have a good
            shot at getting to the steam quarry without further prospecting. In
            anticipation of the amount of smelting needed, I set up an array of
            fans to do that processing. Finally, I built the forge hammer.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, I decided to go out and get leather for a backpack -
            this proved to be quite the challenge, but I eventually got enough.
            Along the way I also got some bamboo - scaffolding would be quite
            helpful, if only I could get string. Some more miscellaneous tasks,
            like making a crafting calculator and a math calculator, as well as
            a basic potato farm, rounds out this chapter.
          </p>
          <p>
            p.s. Apparently the steam mining drill requires large steel plates!
            What gives?!
