            Today, the goal is to get the basic steam age infrastructure
            together and make just enough steel to get a steam mining drill.
            First up was some material gathering - oddly enough, some redstone
            for the non-main-quest progression, in addition to copper and tin.
          </p>
          <p>
            More mining, this time for the required clay, was up next. Despite
            the nearby village having brick roofs, there wasn't any full brick
            blocks, or, at least, not enough for it to be worthwhile.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the materials were gathered, some intensive crafting followed.
            First a bronze boiler, then a bronze mixer (for the better bronze
            mix ratio), then a brief detour making some bricks for the coke
            oven, finally a macerator, water pump, cutting machine, and furnace
            (seeing as how the bulk blasting was free and somewhat faster than a
            furnace, and how the cutting machine required lubricant, I decided
            to leave those for last).
          </p>
          <p>
            While I worked on the later machines, I started the compressor going
            on the bricks needed for the coke oven. After getting the oven, I
            then started work on the steam blast furnace. I decided to take a
            brief break to go make a light ring, since I wasn't happy about
            crafting all the torches needed to light up an underground base by
            hand! A local meteor crater supplied the soul soul needed, but the
            glowstone required a jaunt into the nether. Fortunately, there was a
            lava pool nearby and I didn't need to waste diamonds on a pickaxe.
            More exploration around the overworld ended up with all three
            spectrum basic gems discovered, as an aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some more crafting later, the early steam infrastructure was
            complete and I had my steam mining drill. Time to dig a base out.
            But first, a quick trip to mine some coal ore to be macerated into
            coal dust to fuel the drill.

          <p>Next time - actual construction of the base.</p>
