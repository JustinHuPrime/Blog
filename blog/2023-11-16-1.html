            Time to build the actual base. This is going to be an underground
            base, centered around a "main room", containing a water elevator for
            surface access and the various manual crafting machines. Tunnelling
            outwards in the cardinal directions are four wings - industry,
            magic, food, and miscellaneous.
          </p>
          <p>
            First up was digging the water elevator down to y = -50, and
            constructing the hut at the top.

          <p>
            Next was filling the elevator, after a brief diversion to a local
            meteor site for some soul sand and magma. This was a lengthy process
            that I'm glad I only have to do once.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-10.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next was digging out the planned rooms in the industrial wing - a
            double-wide room for the power plant, a double wide storage room,
            four single-wide rooms for basic refining, advanced refining, basic
            manufacturing, and assembling, another single-wide room for
            quarries, a quadruple-wide room for multiblock processing machines,
            a double wide room for oil processing, and another double wide room
            for the two large multiblocks.
          </p>

          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-12.png" width="50%" />
          <p>And finally, I moved everything down into the permanent base.</p>
          <p>
            Here's the four central rooms - the workshop, the miscellaneous
            room, the kitchen, and the bedroom.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-13.png" width="50%" />
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-14.png" width="50%" />

          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-16.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            And here's the power plant room (currently in use as a general
            manufacturing room).

          <p>Next time, the jump to LV.</p>
