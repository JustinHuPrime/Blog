            The goal this time is to break through to the middle of LV and
            achieve "closure" - where all resources needed for immediate
            expansion are being automatically produced.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, alas, is another mining trip, getting iron, copper, tin,
            gold, aluminium, lead, antimony, quartz, and some redstone. Next was
            crafting 10 analog circuits - enough for an assembler, polarizer,
            and LV steam turbine.
          </p>
          <p>
            After making the two new basic electric machines, next up was
            upgrading all of the existing steam machines to electric. Alas, I
            needed more diamonds, so I went out to try and find a diamond vein.
            This took a while, but wandering around with the prospector's pick
            eventually found a chunk that seems to have diamonds, and digging
            with the steam drill wasn't too troublesome.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterwards, I finished upgrading all of my machines to electric
            machines. Next up, making two steam quarries. I'm making two since
            I'll need a bronze and a steel drill quarry, at the very least. I
            set these up in the storage room for now - I'll move them when I
            work on closure.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-17.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next up was a pyrolyse oven and an EBF - I started crafting cables
            using liquid rubber in the assembler at this point. While I waited
            for things to process, I decided to work on my magic - I had
            previously gotten a pigment pedestal, all the CMY gems, quitoxic
            reeds, and shimmerstone, so I made some fading, and also made the
            magic diamond to enter the twilight forest - my portal room was
            filling out nicely.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-18.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            I set up the heatproof casings processing, and took a short hop into
            the twilight forest to see what was up.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-19.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Along the way, while searching for some venison, I fought the naga.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-20.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Then, I finished making the electric blast furnace and pyrolyse
            oven. I set these up in the storage room for now.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-21.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            I was feeling an energy crunch, so I decided to upgrade my generator
            setup to a large steam boiler and eight turbines, allowing for full
            LV output. While stuff was processing, I went into the twilight
            forest again and defeated the lich.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-22.png" width="50%" />
          <p>Afterwards, I upgraded my boiler setup to full LV power.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-23.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            After that, I made first an electrolyzer (for aluminium), and then a
            chemical reactor (for cheaper electronic circuit components). These
            took some making, let me tell you!
          </p>
          <p>
            With electronic circuit components ready to be produced, I made two
            electric quarries, as I was running low on resources.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-24.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            With the quarries running and moved into the proper room, I made
            some barrels to store the ores.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-25.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next up is the macerators to process those ores, along with the
            mixers and furnaces to turn them into ingots. This took a lot of
            processing, so I did some work on spectrum, getting a full set of
            coloured saplings. I remembered to set up a chunk loader first,
            though! As primary dyes, I needed white, yellow, red, green, and
            blue. White I could get from bone meal, yellow I could get from
            sunflowers, red I could get from roses, green I could get from
            cacti, and blue I could get from lapis.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-26.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Add in a diversion here to make the pyrolysis oven and then I made
            the mixers to make the alloys, and some furnaces. While the furnaces
            were processing, I made the fusion shrine. I also made some electric
            blast furnaces.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-27.png" width="50%" />
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-28.png" width="50%" />
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-29.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next up was some basic metalworking machines - first a set of
            compressors.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-30.png" width="50%" />
          <p>Then a set of cutting machines.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-31.png" width="50%" />
          <p>And finally two polarizers and a set of wiremills.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-32.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Then, packers. (I later realized that I didn't actually need bronze
            rotors, since they weren't used for anything past steel upgrades and
            the steel wiremill.)
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-33.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            And assemblers, split into three categories - soldering,
            rubberizing, and non-fluid, along with a rubber production setup.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-34.png" width="50%" />
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-35.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            At this point, I had achieved closure (almost, minus the logs needed
            for paper and the glass panes for fluid pipes). This factory could
            now run (almost) entirely without manual inputs, but I was still
            missing some manufacturing capabilities. Next time, completing the
            cycle.
