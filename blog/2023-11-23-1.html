            The goal this time is to achieve complete "closure" - where all
            resources needed for immediate expansion are being automatically
            produced.
          </p>
          <p>
            First up, the copper drill quarry for cobblestone, and the
            processing chain to turn that into glass panes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next up is the greenhouse for oak logs. Notably, this is my first
            StaTech-specific multiblock!
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-37.png" width="50%" />
          <p>And interrupting, centralizing water production.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-38.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            And further interrupting, upgrading the power plant to produce full
            MV output and the distribution voltage to MV, as I was maxing out my
            current LV network - and yes, I know I could skip this by having one
            turbine per room or something like that, but distributing
            electricity instead of steam was a lot more convenient in terms of
            end-user infrastructure.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-39.png" width="50%" />
          <p>Finally, aluminium and electronic circuit production.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-40.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            And some more miscellaneous ore processing, although neither
            manganese nor chromium are actually used at the moment, so I didn't
            bother finishing their production lines.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-41.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            I decided this would be a good time to build out the storage array.
            The barrels in the production room are for ores produced by quarries
            specifically; the storage room is for general storage. This acts as
            a buffer to smooth out production rates, avoiding situations where
            the first machine in a chain fills its output buffer before the
            second machine can overclock by enough to match the first machine's
            output rate. While I was waiting, however, I finished off one branch
            of the Spectrum storyline and got bedrock gear.

          <p>Next time, oil and upgrades.</p>
