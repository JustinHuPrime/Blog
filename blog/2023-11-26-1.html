            The goal this time is to get basic oil processing going to make
            upgrades. There's three subtasks - upgrade the energy network to use
            HV distribution, make chromium, and make upgrades.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, making chromium. I decided that I would be getting salt water
            through an oil drilling rig to make brine to electrolyze, and along
            the way I could also upgrade my water pumps to a copper drill rig. I
            set up magnesium and chromium production.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, upgrading the network to use HV distribution - this involved a
            lot of time waiting for aluminum plates to process, in fact, it
            involved AFKing overnight, and that still wasn't quite enough. Some
            minor adjustments to input priorities solved this issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            The actual upgrade process was a bit messy, but since it involved
            temporarily shutting down the factory. The restart wasn't going to
            be a full on black start, where there's no resources in the factory
            at all, but I did have to plan for the water mains being empty. The
            aluminum tank normally used as a water source in the workshop solved
            this issue nicely.
          </p>

          <p>
            Last was the actual upgrade production line. While I was waiting for
            everything to be built, I headed into the end and killed the dragon.
            The fight is a lot easier with fall damage immunity, a helium
            flamingo for temporary flight, and serious knockback resistance from
            the bedrock armour.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-45.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            The first machine to be upgraded was the aluminum blast furnace.
            While I waited for more upgrades to be produced, I went into the
            nether and hunted some wither skeletons. After I came back, I
            upgraded the bauxite electrolyzer, the steel blast furnace, and a
            few other machines in the motor production chain, and then I
            upgraded the upgrade production line. Seeing as how I was starting
            to run low on resources, I also upgraded the bronze and steel drill
            quarries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I made a gold drill quarry. As it happens, the gold
            drill quarry products aren't at all useful. This is probably going
            to languish unupgraded like the copper drill quarry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, I looked into the simple animated guns - that, apparently,
            required brass, which required zinc, which required a zinc drill
            quarry (or I could make it manually, but zinc drills were a good
            source of other materials). I tooled around a bit here building a
            reasonably secure testing room, waiting for the factory to make some
            more upgrades.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the upgrades finished construction, I decided to make some
            secondary production lines - notably, the tuff to carbon dust and
            the carbon-using processes. I then made the stainless steel ingot
            and kanthal ingot processing lines.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-46.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next, I fininshed off the kanthal processing line - I needed to make
            annealed copper since my goal was to make distillation towers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I next made the whole annealed copper processing line, minus the
            cables. This was made simpler since only annealed copper wire was
            relevant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, after some manual crafting, I made the distillation tower
            controllers. The actual stainless steel for the distillation tower
            was taking a while to process, and I noticed that I wasn't making
            full use of my power plant, since the processing room and the
            advanced refining room were maxing out one MV network. Since I had
            both cupronickel and electrum cables to play with, I split both
            networks.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the distillation tower components were done crafting, I set
            about building the actual oil refinery. This involved a lot of
            pipework and reactors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some last cleanup tasks were to setup the rubber sheet from
            styrene-butdiene rubber and PTFE ingot freezers, and the assemblers
            for stainless steel components.

          <p>Next time - the digital age, and going to space.</p>
