          <p>Today, we step into the final frontier.</p>
          <p>
            But first, setting up the production line for stainless steel
            drills. Stainless steel drills in an oil rig were fairly easy, a
            small expansion to the existing oil refinery. The ores were a bit
            more involved - mozanite, and the Tech Reborn ores were pretty
            straightforward, but the titanium and the platinum chains were
            definitely troublesome.
          </p>
          <p>
            Titanium was a pair of EBFs (titanium dust and raw ore into hot
            ingots) and a freezer. Platinum was slightly more involved, with an
            acid processing chain, an EBF, and a freezer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The liquid ender and enderium chain was a lot more involved. I
            needed a mob crusher for endermen, which required basic cards, which
            required certus quartz. Automating this was difficult, I can't get
            certus quartz except by growing the crystals - but perhaps a
            Spectrum crystal apothecary would work?
          </p>
          <p>Nope.</p>
          <p>
            I ended up using ME annihilation planes, but getting only
            fully-grown crystals took quite a bit of fiddling around with ME
            stuff, but I managed in the end.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-48.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next up was the crafting machinery to make the models for the mob
            grinder, and finally, the actual mob grinder.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-49.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Along the way, I upgraded the energy input hatches in the processing
            room to HV, the network distribution voltage. I then finished out
            the enderium production line, putting the EBFs in the space center
            room.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then built the launch silo - it's got a bedrock (from Spectrum)
            reinforced bottom to contain any pad explosions.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the launch silo was built, I got the rocket ready. Since I had
            unlocked waystones, this was going to be a rocket trip to the moon
            to place down a waystone and return via waystone.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-50.png" width="50%" />
          <p>And then, magnificent desolation.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-51.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            I got to digging after some sightseeing, and managed to excavate
            quite a lot of resources quite quickly, which was good, because my
            oxygen reserves were getting low. Next time, I should bring a
            bottomless bundle full of oxygen tanks.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-52.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            After I got back home, I broke down some of the ores with my fortune
            X pickaxe - it's a really cool reward for getting near the end of
            the world of magic questline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, I built out the titanium processing chain - this would be
            needed for the blastproof plates.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a diversion, I also built the platinum processing chain - this
            one was very short, culminating in platinum fine wire.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then set up a pressurizer in the power plant room, and started
            planning out the upgrade to EV distribution - or, more accurately,
            one quarter EV distribution (since the jump to EV power does not
            come with significantly better boilers).
          </p>
          <p>
            I then went around upgrading the pipe outputs to use a pair of
            advanced motors to go full speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I was waiting on turbo machine hulls, I also started some
            tungsten processing, as I was about to head to mars.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-53.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Once again, after some sightseeing, I dug down to find some Ostrum.
            I got quite a lot, since I was likely to need it making blastproof
            ingots.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-54.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next up was processing everything into the actual blastproof plates,
            which was really just a lot of waiting around.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I wanted to upgrade my power plant, and that actually
            required a single EV output hatch, which required I set up the
            production infrastructure for chromium, argon, and silicon wafers.
            Everything else could be microcrafted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, as the blastproof plates finished processing, I set up but
            didn't hook up the implosion compressor.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-55.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            I then upgraded everything to HV hulls, and started crafting in
            preparation for high pressure boilers. This was going to be a
            delicate transition, as the heat exchangers needed power to run. The
            power plant was quickly becoming a power consumer too. Real life
            plants solve this with diesel generators, and I think I could as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, I upgraded to one-quarter EV generation. This was a bit hairy,
            since I was doing a (soft) black start, but there was enough power
            stored in the input hatches to avoid me needing to start the backup
            diesel generator.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-56.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next, we head to Venus for calorite. This was decidedly hostile,
            doubly so since my regular armour with space breathing didn't
            protect me from the heat, even though I had fire resistance.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-57.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Since I'd left behind a waystone, I promptly headed home; Mercury
            was my next destination, to get the space fire proof enchanted book.
            Unfortunately, I had a bit of trouble on landing as I'd landed in
            lava. I had to bail out as the lander capsule was bobbing on the
            surface.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-58.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Returning to Venus, I did some sightseeing, but I got interrupted by
            some acid rain, forcing me to either shelter underground or return
            home. Since I was far from a calorite deposit, I decided to dig up
            some stone, and then return home, to return shortly after to get a
            little calorite to make the acid rain proofing enchantment. I then
            returned and buckled down to mine a few stacks of calorite. I
            decided to get a slight excess since I'd want to make a space probe
            launcher.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-59.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next, I made a gravichestplate, since I had everything I needed to
            make one. I had a bit of an "oops" moment while charging it up,
            however - the heat exchanger had stalled since the high pressure
            water production had filled the water loop and left no room for
            output. Since the high pressure water loop was a completely closed
            system, I disconnected the pressurizer and drained the pipe; this
            should maintain a good amount of pressurized water in the system.
          </p>
          <p>Next time, finishing up the production at the HV tier.</p>
