            We're in the endgame now. Today, we make some singularities, and
            start replication.
          </p>
          <p>First up was building the quasi-quantum singularity forge.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-82.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next was getting three singularities - two for the quantum upgrades
            for the replicator, and one for UU matter production. The first one
            I made was for UU matter production.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-83.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            And the next two were for quantum upgrades, which were immediately
            crafted into a replicator.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-84.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Then, to upgrade my UU-matter production, I made a quantum upgrade,
            using my replicator. My factory was now 99% redundant - I needed
            power production, but other than that, I could replicate anything I
            needed. I needed just the creative tank to get infinite UU matter,
            which was just over an hour worth of production from a single
            electrolyzer. The replicator blacklist, alas, appears to have been
            sufficiently well curated that I couldn't get around this, so I
            applied some time in a bottle.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made a slight mistake while crafting the creative tank - I should
            have hooked up my assembler to the fusion reactor instead of my
            workshop's power grid. Oh well - something to do for the other
            creative components.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next was a creative storage unit, a copy of which I hooked up to the
            superconductor power grid for the assembler.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then made the other creative components - the barrel and the
            motor. The infinity sword and suit took a bit more microcrafting.
            One last replication, and I got the creative worldshaper.
          </p>

          <p>And with that, I've finished StaTech Industry.</p>
