            This is more of a cleanup - I'm going to be finishing up the HV
            production lines, and preparing for the step into EV.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, crafting more blastproof plates for implosion compressors.
            It's interesting how MI often has the machine for making things
            require the things it itself makes, so you have to use some
            alternative route before you can unlock the faster or more automated
            way the machine allows.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, having enough advanced upgrades crafted, I upgraded everything
            to use advanced upgrades. I wanted to be efficient, so I calculated
            how many upgrades were actually needed to max out the overclock.
            This was often less than a full stack for some single-block
            machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            I next set up production of turbo upgrades. After a while, I noticed
            that I was running out of power. As a result I upgraded the power
            plant to full EV.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-61.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next, I headed into orbit to make a space station - unfortunately I
            had a bit of an accident while landing the rocket (and it was a tier
            4 calorite rocket, so quite a lot of crafting time lost there).
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-62.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            I still had some waiting around for the system to make stuff, so I
            decided to remake my rocket and head of interstellar to Glacio.
          </p>

          <p>
            There isn't much to see, actually - it's a real frozen wasteland. Up
            next is processing units, large components, tungstensteel, the space
            probe launcher, space probes and desh drills, wither skeletons,
            withers, titanium drill products, superconductors, and the nuclear
            reactor. Then, nukes and quantum circuits, and that closes out EV.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, a processing line bottleneck I fixed was the aluminium dust
            to ingot EBF. Giving that its own HV connection allowed everything
            else to run at higher power. Maybe in future I should split the
            processing room's power network so each bank of machines has its own
            transformer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, I made the assembler chain for processing units and highly
            advanced hulls, and then the chain for nuclear alloy plates. Further
            fighting against the main bottleneck, I constructed a second
            aluminum dust to ingot EBF.
          </p>
          <p>
            I continued by making the tungstensteel cable chain - I wanted to
            make a space probe launcher. I realized that I had run out of ostrum
            for blastproof plates - this would need to be remedied.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then took a look at my current bottleneck - chromium was an issue.
            This was solved through some further spaghettification of my
            advanced refining room's fluid handling. I also fixed a power
            bottleneck in the processing room, by splitting the HV connections
            in the room to one per kind of machine. Looking at the oil refinery,
            that had a power bottleneck, so I split the drilling rigs and
            distillation towers onto their own network. The aluminum ingot EBFs
            once again were bottlenecked by power, so the cupronickel EBF bank
            got a double HV connection with some kanthal cables. I
            double-checked the refinery, and it too was still power
            bottlenecked, so I upgraded the multiblocks to double HV as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made the space probe launcher, but it's quite likely I won't
            actually use it for anything.
          </p>

          <p>I think there's something wrong with the shaders, though.</p>
          <p>
            Next, I finished off the titanium drill quarry. I now had a full set
            of resource gatherers. While I waited for the quarry to come up to
            speed, I set up the wither skeleton and wither processing line.
            Next, I set up the iridium and uranium processing lines. I decided
            to run my reactor with unenriched uranium, so I wouldn't need to set
            up an enrichment plant.
          </p>
          <p>Next time, going nuclear.</p>
