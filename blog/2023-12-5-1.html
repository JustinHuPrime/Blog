        <h2>A brief introduction to below-C level programming on Linux</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
          You may be aware that I'm doing
          <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023">Advent of Code</a> in
          assembly. You might be wondering where someone learns the (dark) art
          of programming in assembly. Perhaps you'd like to write a compiler, or
          just want to recreate how the programmers of yore did things. So
          here's a brief overview of assembly programming on x86_64 and Linux -
          I'm going to assume that you've read the <code>nasm</code> manual well
          enough to understand assembly syntax, and are a proficient C
          programmer.
        </p>
        <h2>What Your Compiler Does</h2>
        <p>
          Learning assembly is really mostly unwrapping the layer of abstraction
          the C compiler provides - which is actually a really thick layering of
          multiple abstractions. Let's look at one of the thinner layers - the
          compiler driver. What you think of as a C compiler is actually a few
          programs working together, all orchestrated by the compiler driver.
          You can see this if you give <code>gcc</code> the option
          <code>-v</code>. Here's an example, with the irrelevant stuff omitted.
        </p>
        <pre>
justin@Carbon ~/AdventOfCode> gcc -v hello.c -o hello
 cc1 hello.c -o /tmp/ccEY5VjO.s
 as -o /tmp/ccJ9QAxD.o /tmp/ccEY5VjO.s
 collect2 -o hello /tmp/ccJ9QAxD.o -lc</pre
        >
        <p>
          Let's break this down a bit. When I ask <code>gcc</code> to compile a
          file, first, it delegates the transformation of the file from C to
          assembly over to <code>cc1</code>, the actual compiler program. This
          is a part that gets skipped when you're writing assembly directly.
          Then, it asks the system assembler, <code>as</code>, to assemble the
          file into an object file. Finally, it asks the linker,
          <code>collect2</code> (which is itself a wrapper around the actual
          linker, <code>ld</code>), to link the object file with the C standard
          library (another thing that you don't have when working in assembly)
          and produce the executable named <code>hello</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actual sequence of commands to produce some assembly is largely
          similar to what your compiler does.
        </p>
        <pre>
justin@Carbon ~/AdventOfCode> nasm -f elf64 common.s
justin@Carbon ~/AdventOfCode> nasm -f elf64 5a.s
justin@Carbon ~/AdventOfCode> ld -o 5a 5a.o common.o</pre
        >
        <p>
          We ask the assembler (I'm using <code>nasm</code> since its syntax is
          a lot nicer to work with) to compile our assembly files into object
          files (the output file name can be implicit), and then we ask the
          linker to produce a executable. (<code>nasm</code> unhelpfully
          defaults to 32-bit ELF files, even on my 64-bit system, so we need to
          tell it otherwise.)
        </p>
        <h2>Just What is a Program Anyway</h2>
        <p>
          So now let's talk about ELF files - the Executable and Linkable Format
          is a file format for binary data. Both object files and executables
          are ELF files, and I'll get into the exact differences later. In
          general, an ELF file consists of sections; when a program is run,
          Linux will load those sections into memory (from where in the file and
          to where in memory based on information stored in the ELF file - in
          the program header table), set all registers except the instruction
          pointer and stack pointer to zero, set up the stack, and start
          userspace execution with the instruction pointer set to the value
          specified in the ELF file.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the ELF file manipulation is the province of the assembler and
          the linker. Your job, as the programmer, is to tell the assembler what
          sections you would like to have, and what the contents of those
          sections are. So what sections could you have? There's four main types
          your assembler recognizes. There's <code>.text</code> sections (yes,
          the period is intentional - section names always start with a dot,
          don't ask me why), which contain the actual assembly code of your
          program. There's <code>.data</code> sections - these contain data that
          your program may read and modify. There's
          <code>.rodata</code> sections - these contain data that your program
          may only read. This is usually where string literals are kept.
          Finally, there's <code>.bss</code> sections, where zero-initialized
          writable data is kept. (<code>.bss</code> stands for block started by
          symbol - it's historical baggage; x86_64 assembly has enough
          historical baggage to fill an airliner.) You'd use a
          <code>.bss</code> section because however much you have, it takes up a
          constant amount of disk space (constant because the section still
          needs to have its metadata and size stored in the ELF file).
        </p>
        <p>
          Only the linker and the assembler really care about section types -
          they're a construct that your assembler has decided to provide.
          There's nothing in ELF stopping you from declaring a section that is
          not readable and only writable, or a section that is readable,
          writable, and executable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let's get to the difference between object files and executable
          files. The linker takes in object files, decides where everything goes
          in memory in absolute terms, and produces an executable. The main
          difference between object files and executables is that object files
          have a relocation table, and executable files don't. Suppose I want
          one object file to call a function defined elsewhere. I need to know
          the address of the function to call it, but I only know that once the
          linker decides where everything goes in memory in absolute terms. So
          the assembler will add an entry into the relocation section
          instructing the linker to edit the code and insert the absolute
          address of the function once it's known. Likewise, the assembler, for
          the other file, will add an entry to the symbol table section
          declaring that the function with this name may be found at some offset
          in this file's text section. And then the linker must reconcile these
          tables, except it also needs to know where the entry point of the
          program should be - where the instruction pointer should point when
          the program starts. That's traditionally pointed at the symbol
          <code>_start</code> in the text section. Interestingly, the linker
          keeps the symbol table around in the finished executable (the
          <code>strip</code> command discards these). This is quite convenient
          since assemblers don't include any more detailed kind of debugging
          symbols, but <code>gdb</code> is perfectly happy to read the included
          symbol table.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an aside, your C compiler won't actually produce any code for the
          <code>_start</code> symbol - the main function is at a symbol called
          <code>main</code> (more or less - some C compilers prefix C symbols
          with an underscore). The C standard library supplies a wrapper at
          <code>_start</code> that does some work to get the command line
          arguments (see below) into the expected locations before calling main
          and then making the <code>exit</code> syscall, among other things.
          This is necessarily written in assembly - which is, perhaps, a reason
          you might want to know how to at least read assembly: so you can
          understand how your program's runtime environment gets set up. This is
          also where, in languages with non-constant global variables, those
          variables are initialized. For more information, see
          <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Initialization.html"
            >GCC's documentation on constructors and initialization</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Doing Things</h2>
        <p>
          Okay - let's cover actual assembly programming. Remember that, since
          this is assembly, almost everything is a matter of programmer
          convention and almost nothing is enforced by your environment. You've
          got 16 registers, accessible as either a single byte, a word (two
          bytes), a doubleword (four bytes), or a quadword (eight bytes). Notice
          that I didn't mention anything about what those bytes might store.
          It's up to you, the programmer, to enforce type rules. The first eight
          registers are the original eight, and some of them are specifically
          referenced in some instructions as an implicit operand - this
          shouldn't stop you from using them as general purpose registers most
          of the time.
          <code>rax</code> was the accumulator, and it's often the implicit
          source operand of some instructions, like the
          <code>mul</code> instruction. <code>rbx</code> isn't often a special
          register, but <code>rcx</code> is special, and is often used as a
          counter. <code>rdx</code> is occasionally used to extend
          <code>rax</code> to twice its usual length, again, see the
          <code>mul</code> instruction for an example. <code>rsi</code> and
          <code>rdi</code> are used in string operations. <code>rsp</code> is
          the only one that's special all the time - it's the stack pointer.
          <code>rbp</code> is the base pointer (i.e. it points to the return
          address on the stack), but it can also be used as a special purpose
          register. The rest, which are numbered and not named, are general
          purpose registers all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the basic arithmetic operations you'd be familiar with in a
          high level language have direct counterparts in assembly - addition
          (<code>add</code>) and subtraction (<code>sub</code>) work on signed
          and unsigned numbers with the same instruction. Multiplication is
          split into signed (<code>imul</code>) and unsigned (<code>mul</code>),
          as is division (<code>idiv</code>, <code>div</code>). You'll often
          want to avoid multiplication and especially division, since unsigned
          multiplication and division require you to fiddle around with the
          special purpose uses of <code>rax</code> and <code>rdx</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Control flow, however, is a bit less congruent. You have three main
          control-flow primitives - unconditional jumps, conditional jumps, and
          function calls. Unconditional jumps and conditional jumps can be used
          to make the equivalent of if/else statements and loops. Here's an
          example of a simple if statement:
        </p>
        <pre>
  cmp rax, 0
  jne .notZero

  ; rax is zero
  add rax, 5

.notZero:
        </pre>
        <p>
          We do a comparison of <code>rax</code> with zero, and then, if it's
          not equal to zero, we jump to the label <code>.notZero</code>. The
          overall effect of this is that if <code>rax</code> is zero, then it
          becomes five; otherwise, it stays the same. There's two main
          comparison operations - <code>cmp</code>, which subtracts the second
          operand from the first and sets the flags according to the result, and
          <code>test</code>, which does a bitwise-and of the two operands and
          sets the flags according to the result. The flags register (you can't
          directly interact with this one) is queried when doing a conditional
          jump. Note that a <code>cmp</code> followed by a relational-style
          conditional jump, like <code>jle</code>, will jump if the first
          operand has the indicated relation to the second operand. (In math
          speak, <i>a</i> - <i>b</i> is related to zero identically to how
          <i>a</i> is related to <i>b</i>). There's also the negations of each
          sort of conditional jump - <code>jnle</code>, for example (which,
          incidentally, is equivalent, both logically and in the assembly, to
          <code>jg</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the relational conditional jumps, you can also query
          the state of individual flags directly - you can condition on the
          carry flag, the overflow flag, the parity flag, the sign flag, and the
          zero flag being either on or off. This is useful if, for example,
          you've done a <code>test</code> and you want to jump if the result was
          zero - you'd do a <code>jz</code>, which expresses your intent a lot
          better than the equivalent <code>je</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <code>cmp x, 0</code> is equivalent to
          <code>test x, x</code>, except like most instructions, you can only
          have one memory operand per <code>test</code> instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to jumping forwards, you can also jump back, allowing you
          to construct loops and even more control flow than the (admittedly
          uncommonly felt) limitations of structured programming. Goto
          considered harmful? In assembly, there's only gotos.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last bit of control flow is the <code>call</code> instruction. It
          takes a destination address (usually in the form of a label), and will
          redirect the instruction pointer to that address until a
          <code>ret</code> is encountered, after which time the instruction
          pointer returns to just after the <code>call</code> instruction. Just
          like a function call. Note, however, there's no arguments nor any
          return value - you have to construct that yourself. To provide
          arguments, you'd put them in registers or in specific locations on the
          stack, and to get a return value, you'd read it from a register or off
          of the stack. I'd recommend sticking to the
          <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/System_V_ABI#x86-64"
            >System V calling convention</a
          >
          if you're writing something intended to be used in a different file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, let's touch on memory access. At some point, you're going to
          need to store some data somewhere that isn't a register. You've got
          three options. You either store it in the stack - at the start of your
          function, you subtract from the stack pointer to allocate space (on
          Linux, the stack grows downwards), and store data there. Or you store
          it in static memory - some space allocated in the
          <code>.data</code> or <code>.bss</code> section. Or you store it in
          the heap. You'd use the <code>brk</code> syscall (see below) to
          allocate some space, and store the data there. But remember that
          you're going to need to store the pointer to that data on the heap
          somewhere as well!
        </p>
        <p>So how does one allocate some space in a data section? Like this:</p>
        <pre>
section .data
variable: dq 42</pre
        >
        <p>
          This declares a quadword worth of memory in the data section whose
          address is represented in the symbol <code>variable</code>. You can
          access the value by saying <code>[variable]</code> - you're using the
          plain old displacement addressing mode. See
          <a
            href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/06/13/How-x86_64-addresses-memory"
            >this blog post by William Woodruff</a
          >
          for a more in-depth discussion of addressing memory. An interesting
          quirk of <code>gdb</code> is that it allows you to directly view the
          contents of the address, but only by asking it to print out the
          contents of the name - while it is true in C and other higher level
          languages that such a symbol ought to be interpreted as the location
          of some static variable, in assembly, it's necessary to understand
          that it's still a pointer, just a pointer to statically allocated
          memory. Thus, in assembly code, when you say <code>variable</code>,
          you are getting the address pointed to by the label, while in
          <code>gdb</code>, you're getting the contents of the address labelled.
          This tripped me up a few times when I was using <code>gdb</code> to
          debug my code. While <code>gdb</code> supports assembly, its main
          target is still the high level languages, like C, and in times like
          this, it shows.
        </p>
        <h2>The Environment</h2>
        <p>
          So you can now run instructions, but instructions without input are
          not very useful. You can get some input by reading the command line
          arguments - when Linux sets up your program's stack, it puts the
          number of command line arguments to
          <code>QWORD [rsp + 0]</code> and pointers to the command line
          arguments in <code>QWORD [rsp + 8]</code> onwards, if there are any,
          followed by a null pointer and then a pointer to the environment
          string (see <code>man env</code> for more details on this). Most
          shells supply at least one - the name your command was invoked with.
          For example, running <code>./compare one two</code> would result in
          <code>QWORD [rsp + 0]</code> being 3,
          <code>QWORD [rsp + 8]</code> begin a pointer to
          <code>"./compare"</code>, <code>QWORD [rsp + 16]</code> being a
          pointer to <code>"one"</code>, <code>QWORD [rsp + 24]</code> being a
          pointer to <code>"two"</code>, <code>QWORD [rsp + 32]</code> being
          zero, and <code>QWORD [rsp + 40]</code> being a pointer to the
          environment string.
        </p>
        <p>
          So you can get input (in the form of strings) from the command line,
          but you don't know how to exit the program (no, you can't just
          <code>hlt</code> - that would halt the entire core, and only Linux is
          allowed to do that) and you don't know how to write to the command
          line yet. Here's how you do every other bit of interacting with the
          operating system: <code>syscall</code>. <code>syscall</code> is a
          special instruction that raises an interrupt that Linux will catch and
          process. See <code>man 2 syscall</code> for more info, and
          <code>man 2 syscalls</code> for a list. To make a syscall in assembly,
          you'd put the syscall number in <code>rax</code>, the arguments in
          <code>rdi</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdx</code>,
          <code>r10</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, and execute the
          <code>syscall</code> instruction. One example syscall is exit - number
          60. Here's how you'd use it:
        </p>
        <pre>
  mov rdi, 0
  mov rax, 60
  syscall</pre
        >
        <p>
          You set the first and only argument to the exit code (which is
          truncated by the OS to a byte), and you set the system call number to
          60, and make the syscall. You don't care what comes after, since your
          program will definitely have exited and will have ceased to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the other system calls I use are <code>open</code>,
          <code>fstat</code>, and <code>mmap</code> - these allow me to
          memory-map the input files from Advent of Code so I can just parse
          through them using pointers. Additionally, <code>brk</code> lets you
          allocate heap space - but note that the assembly version of
          <code>brk</code>, unlike most system calls, does not have the same
          interface as the C library version.
        </p>
        <h2>In Conclusion - Why?</h2>
        <p>
          I would be the first person to tell you that doing assembly
          programming in this day and age is useful only to compiler writers, OS
          developers, and some folks writing very specialized libraries (like
          the folks behind GMP, for example). There's no real reason why you'd
          want to program in assembly, and in fact, you often can't beat GCC in
          terms of performance, and you certainly can't beat even C for ease of
          use. So why learn to program in assembly? For the same reason that
          half this blog post isn't about assembly - you get to peek behind the
          curtain and learn about the abstractions that back our modern
          computing environment, and understand the influence this foundational
          layer has. For example, the reason why the C modulo operator
          (<code>%</code>) actually does a remainder operation is because the
          <code>idiv</code> instruction specifies that it returns the quotient
          and the remainder, not the quotient and the modulus; the reason why
          right shift of a negative signed number is hazardous in C is because
          there's two possible instructions the compiler could emit, and one
          does an arithmetic shift, filling with the sign bit, while the other
          does a logical shift, filling with zero; and the reason why you can
          (mostly) run 32 bit programs on 64 bit computers is because x86 is
          binary-compatible with x86_64.
