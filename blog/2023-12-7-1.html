          <p>Today, we go nuclear, both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.</p>
          <p>
            I set up the reactor - it's fuelled by natural uranium, and the
            inner area is low-pressure light water cooled. There's an outer
            jacket of low-pressure heavy water for tritium production. I decided
            to place it in the advanced processing room since its primary
            purpose wasn't really energy generation - it was plutonium
            production.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-65.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next, I built out the superconductor cable production chain, then
            the space probe production chain - the desh drill part would be
            useful for the core mining drill, and the ostrum would be useful for
            blastproof plates and nuclear alloy plates.
          </p>
          <p>
            I next set up the quantum circuit production chain and the highly
            advanced upgrade production chain, and then wandered off into the
            twilight forest as the factory processed things. There, I fought the
            Minoshroom.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-66.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            I kept wandering around - I was going to go fight the hydra next.
            Hopefully my fire resistance would help here. It did - I was
            completely immune to the ranged attacks of the hydra.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-67.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next up, the Alpha Yeti. Fall damage immunity really helped here.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-68.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Deeper in I went, petting the penguins along the way - I was headed
            to the snow queen's palace.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-69.png" width="50%" />
          <p>Next, I headed for the knight phantoms and the carminite tower.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-70.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            The tower was pretty tall and intimidating, but I had a
            gravichestplate.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-71.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            The factory had fininshed producing resources at this point, so I
            went around and upgraded everything to EV hulls. While I was waiting
            for the fusion reactor components to process, I went into the
            twilight forest again, and visited the questing ram.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-72.png" width="50%" />
          <p>I then hunted some trolls in the highlands.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-73.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Afterwards, I planted the magic beans, and headed up the beanstalk
            to the giants' home.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-74.png" width="50%" />
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-75.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Having gotten the giant pickaxe, I went down and broke into the
            trolls' obsidian vault, and took the lamp of cinders and started
            burning my way to the final castle.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-76.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Alas, there did my journey end, for the castle has no boss to fight.
            There was no more progression past here.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-77.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Although, just what was in the basement of the castle? A whole bunch
            of cells, apparently.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-78.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Next, I went back and set up the core mining drill, along with a
            fusion reactor.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-79.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            The fusion reactor is primarily intended for neutronium production -
            I'll be adding a second ring on top later to make the neutronium. I
            next set up the core mining drill.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/statech-80.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Most of it was buried underground. With access to core fragments, I
            now put together the processing chain for ultradense metal balls.
            Next, I built the neutronium fusion reactor.
          </p>

          <p>Next time, the singularity forge and endgame.</p>
