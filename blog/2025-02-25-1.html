            I've started another Minecraft modpack playthrough - this time it's
            <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/monifactory"
              >Monifactory</a
            >
            by <a href="https://discord.gg/pansmith">Pansmith</a> (who also has
            modern ports of some other packs). I've decided to pick up a
            GregTech pack since I'm interested in the greater depth of systems
            GregTech offers compared to
            <a
              href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-industrialization"
              >Modern Industrialization</a
            >
            (which I previously played in my
            <a href="/blog/2023-11-14-1.html">StaTech Industry</a> run) - in
            particular, I'm interested in amperage, research, and computation,
            as well as the increased number of tiers of machines. I am concerned
            that I might not make it through the pack since I've still not quite
            figured out how best to automate crafting in GregTech - Modern
            Industrialization was pretty clear that everything should be
            passively automated (i.e. there's a complete pipeline of machines
            from resource production to final crafting component) starting from
            the end of the LV tier, but in my playthroughs of the
            <a
              href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gregtech-community-pack-modern"
              >GregTech Community Pack Modern</a
            >, I've found that the lack of early-game automated resource
            production and difficult logistics made passive automation
            troublesome. I did also decide to play in expert mode, since I'm
            looking for a pure GregTech experience without involving EnderIO or
            Thermal - this is probably hubris, but I'm doing it anyways.

            A brief aside on the history of this pack. In the beginning, there
            was
            <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/omnifactory"
              >Omnifactory</a
            >, a Minecraft 1.12.2 GregTech pack focusing on factory building and
            grind reduction. Then there was
            <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomifactory"
              >Nomifactory</a
            >, a fork of Omnifactory that was made after Omnifactory's
            development slowed down in 2020 or so, but that stayed on Minecraft
            1.12.2. Finally, there's Monifactory, for Minecraft 1.20.1 using
            <a
              href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregtechceu-modern"
              >GregTech CEu Modern</a
            >.

            As before, I took a look through the questbook and recipes. Here's a
            few observations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I'm somewhat comforted - it looks like renewable infinite
              resources are possible around HV from crafting and using tier 1
              microminers
            </li>
            <li>
              The pack is in beta, which I should expect since I was looking for
              a GTCEuM pack - hopefully there's no bad bugs
            </li>
            <li>
              Iron furnaces greatly speed up early-game resource processing -
              I'm glad they're in the pack
            </li>
            <li>
              There's a lot more AE2 stuff than I expected - perhaps I should
              heed this warning, but I think I'll play on regardless
            </li>
            <li>
              Snicker snicker - Dilithium has the chemical structure Li<sub
                >2</sub
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Progression seems like pretty standard GT progression - just with
              a few side branches and more content after UHV
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Next up, actually playing.</p>
