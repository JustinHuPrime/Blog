            Here's the world - an eerily abandoned city overgrown with jungle:
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-1.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            The first step in almost every modpack is to wander around and raid
            structures. Since Monifactory Expert mode forces you into peaceful
            to avoid mob farming, I'll consider the peaceful structure raiding
            just compensation. My main target is the oil drilling rigs - those
            generate with diamonds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Er, perhaps I should get a stone pick first - it'll be helpful for
            picking up furnaces and breaking down iron doors.
          </p>
          <p>Ooh, wood crafting has been Gregged!</p>
          <p>
            Oh, I got a bucket! Buckets are perhaps the single most useful
            mobility item in Minecraft - you can climb and drop easily with a
            bucket of water. And buckets are always Gregged, so finding one is
            actually quite a large shortcut.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also collected a few doors - this action might be familiar to GTNH
            players.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm done with this lost city - I got a fair amount of resources, but
            nothing exceptional. Let's find some more structures - but perhaps
            not another lost city.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-2.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Praise be, I've found a village! I can take a bed from it! (Once
            again, this might be familiar to GTNH players.)
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-3.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            I also found a bounty board - too bad I can't spend Monicoins in
            expert mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ended up settling down and making some basic machines - my first
            large task, however, was a primitive blast furnace.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-4.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Processing the materials was taking forever, though, but then I
            remembered that I had some steel from my looting earlier. I upgraded
            all of my machines to high pressure - hooray for sequence-breaking.
            I then made the PBF and started producing steel.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-5.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Using some of the steel to make a Nether telepastry, I entered the
            Nether. Gosh, what a desolate place.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-6.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Some more work on the base later, I discovered that iron golems
            still dropped ingots! Iron farm, here I come! While I was looking
            into that, I started processing for the materials for three more
            PBFs, taking advantage of wallsharing.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-7.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            While the iron farm worked on building up enough iron to make a
            batch of steel in my PBFs, I started working on LV. One prerequisite
            of this, though, is that my base needs to be under cover so the
            machines aren't exposed to rain - thankfully I have a fair supply of
            cobblestone and a stonecutter. Some building and crafting later, and
            I was ready to tackle LV. (I also added some shaders.)
