            Time to finish off LV and start basebuilding. First up, getting all
            the LV machines. I think the first priority is a bender to reduce
            the cost of plates. Time for another round of microcrafting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, polarizer and lathe. Then chemical reactor, fluid solidifier,
            and extractor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, taking a return back to the steam age to make all the steam
            multiblocks.
          </p>

          <p>These should really help with processing.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-10.png" width="50%" />
          <p>Next, the assembler, then the rest of the LV machines.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-11.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            My plan at this point was to microcraft my way to HV, where I would
            switch to an AE-based setup, and the slowly passive-craft components
            as my microminer capabilities scaled up. First order of business, a
            proper storage upgrade. Wait... that also needs aluminium. Let's
            make an EBF first, then.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-12.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Let's put the move to ME off some more and make a circuit assembler,
            the phenol needed for which pretty much requires a pyrolysis oven -
            and that's also generally useful anyways.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next up, upgrading my power generation. I have enough boilers for 8A
            LV power, which I'd like to use to run my EBF continuously to make
            aluminium, I just needed to upgrade the piping, turbines, and
            wiring. Running the EBF resulted in some CO in the air, which was my
            first brush with the pollution mechanic.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-14.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            For my penultimate task before building the base, upgrading my
            machines to MV.
          </p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-15.png" width="50%" />
          <p>And finally, using some fossil fuel power for my EBF.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/blog/monifactory-16.png" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Now, while the EBF processes, I'm going to start laying out the
            foundation for my real base. It's going to lay on a circular
            platform in the void dimension - I'm aiming for the aesthetic of the
            Star Trek Online Voth Ground Battlezone for the platform.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, I upgraded my EBF and got an MV circuit assembler. I was
            officially out of LV and into the midgame. As for my base, I needed
            to fill in the foundation and add some landscaping before building a
            few buildings atop the base. Each building would have a broad
            purpose, and they'd all be linked together with ME cabling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Last, for my final project at the end of MV, I set up Benzene power
            production in the real base; this produces about 9A HV, but since
            it's using a fluid fuel, I could easily buffer quite a lot of
            energy.
